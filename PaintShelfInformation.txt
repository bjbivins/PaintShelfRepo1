BRIEF OVERVIEW
I have chosen to use NHTSA named Decode VIN. This API Decodes a vehicles VIN number and returns several features for that specified vehicle. The responses I will be using in my Paint Shelf project are Make, Model, Paint Code, and Paint Name if plausible. Out of all API’s I have found, NHTSA’s update time stamp is the newest. All the API’s on NHTSA are free to use and give a whole lot of information for every car o the road already, as other studied API’s are made for vehicles being sold. The Decode VIN API returns information in XML, CVS, and JSON. This will satisfy my project requirements by allowing the user to search a VIN code and year and be given their paint code for the vehicle that VIN number is associated with.

TARGET AUDIENCE
The Target Audience for Paint Shelf is for automotive painters to help them find a specific paint code in seconds rather than search hundreds of paint cans that are stored on the shelf. If the painter has used that paint, there is some left on the shelf then the user can verify that no paint needs to be mixed or bought for the current project. Because of the harmful chemicals used in automotive paint, Paint Shelf’s targeted age group is 18+, or to certified automotive paint technicians. The targeted gender is neutral as there are several successful men and women painters across the globe. The users should have training in handling and understanding of the dangers the chemicals have. There are several painters who don’t have a high school diploma, or any college experience, but all painters must be certified in safety training. Income level of the targeted users is 10,000+. The user will most likely be employed when they are using Paint Shelf. The user will need a device to run Paint Shelf, most likely their personal device or a work device that is given to the user to use. Family situations do not affect the target audience. Paint Shelf will be available across North America, focusing on the United States of America and Canada. Paint Size plans to add language features to help with those who don’t speak English and add more locations in the future. Other companies who are competing with Paint Shelf would be large paint companies such as PPG, Deltron, AXALTA, DuPont, Omni, etc.

BRAINSTORMING
I plan on creating the main application interface with simplicity in mind. Using other applications as a guideline on how they were designed, such as a hamburger menu in the top left corner of the screen, search bar on top of the screen and filters in the top right corner. The given feature requirement is the VIN reader to help retrieve paint codes off vehicles that don’t display the paint code, or the paint code is hidden in various places. I decided to use the hub and spoke hierarchy because I think it will benefit my applications feel. On the main screen there will be colored buttons, clicking on the buttons will take the user to a new screen which will then allow the user to view all of the different paint in the specified color category, clicking the paint will take the user to the paint information which will display what make and year the paint is used for. The types of navigational constructs I will be using is the hamburger menu, search bar, and filters. When the user is on the home screen, the search bar will search the database for a specific paint codes regardless of the color. The search bar on the screen of the selected color will search only paint codes that are the selected color, as well as the paint name.
